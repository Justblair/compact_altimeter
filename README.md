# compact_altimeter

Very much incomplete right now, but this project is experimental, the intention is to use a ESP8266-01 Module with a BMP180 to create a lightweight altimeter for flying in model rockets.

The altimeter will beam back altitude in near real time, the results to be both displayed on a tft screen and read out loud,
